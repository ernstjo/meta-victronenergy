# Most raspberrypi's have a onboard ethernet. So use its MAC address as
# unique-id, since it is worldwide unique. The raspberrypi zero wifi models
# lack an onboard ethernet though. So use the wifi from them instead.
#
# NOTE: to keep this deterministic, don't base this on the presence of an
# interface. An usb dongle being plugged in, might provide a wlan or ethernet
# interface, that should _not_ change the unique-id.
